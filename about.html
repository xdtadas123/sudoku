          <h2>Magic Squares</h2>
          <p>The long and interesting history of Sudoku is quite a puzzle in itself. Sudoku has deep roots in
            ancient number puzzles. For many centuries people have been interested in creating and solving them.
            Puzzles continue to stimulate new development in mathematics.</p>
          <p>Magic Square puzzles involve ordering consecutive numbers into a square. All rows, columns and
            diagonals must add up to the same number, and each number can only be used once. Solutions were
            thought to have mystical properties and became part of the Chinese <em>I Ching</em> method of telling
            the future.</p>
          <p>The 3×3 solution called the <em>Lo Shu diagram</em> was regarded as a gift from a turtle emerging
            from the River Lo. The idea travelled from China, through Arabic mathematicians, and eventually
            reached Europe.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Puzzle</h2>
          <p>The Chinese Puzzle consists of a 3×3 grid with one square missing. The tiles have to be slid one at
            a time to form an ascending sequence. Later versions use pictures instead of digits, but the idea is
            the same: find a strategy to reorder the squares. Like Sudoku, it is about logical moves rather than
            arithmetic.</p>
          <p>Players quickly discover that certain moves only seem to help, while actually leading them into dead
            ends that must be carefully undone. Because every tile movement affects the others, success depends on
            seeing the grid as a whole rather than focusing on a single square.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Genius</h2>
          <p>The great mathematician <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> is chiefly credited with creating the
            ancestor of modern Sudoku. Born in Basel in 1707, he made huge contributions across mathematics –
            from analysis to number theory – and even when blind in later life he continued to publish
            important work.</p>
          <p>Euler introduced the now-standard symbols <strong>π</strong> for the circle number and
            <strong>i</strong> for the square root of −1. As a kind of pastime he studied arrangement puzzles
            using letters instead of numbers.

          <h2>Graeco–Latin Squares</h2>
          <p>Euler’s ‘Graeco-Latin squares’ – or Latin squares – remove the diagonal-sum condition of magic
            squares and focus on permutations. The first four Greek letters α, β, γ, δ are combined with Latin
            letters A, B, C, D so that each pair occurs once in every row and column, and often once in each
            region as well. This structure is very close to the logic of Sudoku.</p>

          <h2>Journey to America</h2>
          <p>Euler’s ideas slept for centuries. Around 1979, Howard Garns revived them as a puzzle called
            <em>Number Place</em> in the American Dell puzzle magazines. The twist was to divide the 9×9 grid
            into nine 3×3 regions. Every row, column and region must contain each number 1–9 exactly once – the
            modern Sudoku rule set.
          </p>
          <p>Garns was a retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor from Indiana, who designed Number Place in
            his spare time for Dell’s Pencil Puzzles and Word Games magazine.
            The earliest known Number Place grids appeared in the May 1979 issue, and Dell has continued to use this
            original name for the puzzle in its publications.

          <h2>Over the Pacific to Japan</h2>
          <p>The puzzle crossed the Pacific to Japan, where it fit perfectly into newspapers that found
            crosswords awkward for the Japanese writing system. The name <strong>Su Doku</strong> (数独) means
            roughly “numbers only” or “single number”. The Japanese insisted on symmetric clue patterns and a
            controlled difficulty level, refining the puzzle we know today.</p>
          <p>From there Sudoku returned to the U.S. and Europe and became a worldwide craze with championships
            and daily grids in newspapers everywhere.</p>
